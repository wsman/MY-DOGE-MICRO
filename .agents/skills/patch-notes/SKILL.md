## User Guide

- When to use: Generate release notes from git history, sprint data, and internal changelogs. Game: player-facing patch notes. Product: developer-facing release notes with API/CLI/UI categories.
- Inputs: Command arguments: `/patch-notes [version] [--style brief|detailed|full] [--audience players|developers|all]`; project artifacts referenced below; user decisions and approvals before writes.
- Outputs: Primary artifacts, reports, or conversation guidance described below; write files only after user approval.
- Memory-bank writes: None.
- Next steps: Follow the workflow hand-off or next-step guidance below; recommendations do not auto-run and require explicit user command/approval.

## Phase 0: Domain Detection

Detect the project domain by checking for concept documents in `design/cdd/`:

- **Game**: `design/cdd/game-concept.md` exists → use `[Game]` paths below
- **Product**: `design/cdd/product-concept.md` exists → use `[Product]` paths below
- **Neither**: default to game paths (preserves backward compatibility)

---

## Phase 1: Parse Arguments

- `version`: the release version to generate notes for (e.g., `1.2.0`)
- `--style`: output style — `brief` (bullet points), `detailed` (with context), `full` (with developer commentary). Default: `detailed`.
- `--audience`: **[Game]** `players` (default). **[Product]** `developers` (for API/CLI users), `users` (for end-user features), `all` (both). Default: `developers` for product, `players` for game.

If no version is provided, ask the user before proceeding.

---

## Phase 2: Gather Change Data

- Read the internal changelog at `production/releases/[version]/changelog.md` if it exists
- Also check `docs/CHANGELOG.md` for the relevant version entry
- Run `git log` between the previous release tag and current tag/HEAD as a fallback
- Read sprint retrospectives in `production/sprints/` for context
- **[Game]** Read any balance change documents in `design/balance/`
- **[Game]** Read bug fix records from QA if available
- **[Product]** Read migration files and API spec diffs if available

**If no changelog data is available** (neither `production/releases/[version]/changelog.md`
nor a `docs/CHANGELOG.md` entry for this version exists, and git log is empty or unavailable):

> "No changelog data found for [version]. Run `/changelog [version]` first to generate the
> internal changelog, then re-run `/patch-notes [version]`."

Verdict: **BLOCKED** — stop here without generating notes.

---

## Phase 2b: Detect Tone Guide and Template

**Tone guide detection** — before drafting notes, check for writing style guidance:

1. Check `standards/technical-preferences.md` for any "tone", "voice", or "style"
   fields or sections.
2. Check `docs/PATCH-NOTES-STYLE.md` if it exists.
3. **[Game]** Check `design/community/tone-guide.md` if it exists.
4. If any source contains tone/voice/style instructions, extract them and apply
   them to the language and framing of the generated notes.
5. If no tone guidance is found anywhere, default to domain-appropriate tone:
   - **[Game]** Player-friendly, non-technical language; enthusiastic but not hyperbolic;
     focus on what the player experiences, not what the developer changed.
   - **[Product]** Developer-friendly, precise language; include breaking changes
     prominently; include migration steps; focus on what changed and why.

**Template detection** — check whether a release notes template exists:

1. Glob for `docs/patch-notes-template.md` and `templates/patch-notes-template.md`.
2. If found at either location, read it and use it as the output structure for Phase 4.
3. If not found, use the built-in style templates as defined in Phase 4.

## Phase 3: Categorize and Translate

### [Game] Player-Facing Categories

Categorize all changes into player-facing categories:

- **New Content**: new features, maps, characters, items, modes
- **Gameplay Changes**: balance adjustments, mechanic changes, progression changes
- **Quality of Life**: UI improvements, convenience features, accessibility
- **Bug Fixes**: grouped by system (combat, UI, networking, etc.)
- **Performance**: optimization improvements players might notice
- **Known Issues**: transparency about unresolved problems

Translate developer language to player language:

- "Refactored damage calculation pipeline" → "Improved hit detection accuracy"
- "Fixed null reference in inventory manager" → "Fixed a crash when opening inventory"
- "Reduced GC allocations in combat loop" → "Improved combat performance"
- Remove purely internal changes that don't affect players
- Preserve specific numbers for balance changes (damage: 50 → 45)

### [Product] Developer-Facing Categories

Categorize all changes into developer/user-facing categories:

- **Breaking Changes**: API changes that require consumer updates, removed endpoints, changed behaviour
- **New Features**: new endpoints, new CLI commands, new SDK methods, new capabilities
- **Improvements**: performance gains, error message improvements, documentation updates
- **Bug Fixes**: grouped by component (API, CLI, SDK, UI)
- **Deprecations**: features/endpoints that will be removed in a future version (with timeline)
- **Security**: security fixes (include CVE references if applicable)
- **Dependency Updates**: notable dependency changes (major versions, security patches)
- **Migration Guide**: step-by-step instructions for upgrading (if breaking changes exist)
- **Known Issues**: transparency about unresolved problems

Translate developer-internal language to release note language:

- Internal refactoring that doesn't affect the API surface → omit
- "Changed the auth middleware" → "Authentication now requires `X-API-Key` header (see migration guide)"
- Include specific error code changes, response shape changes, CLI flag renames
- Always state upgrade impact: "No action required" / "Action required: [what to do]"

## Phase 5: Review Output

**[Game]** Check the generated notes for:
- No internal jargon (replace technical terms with player-friendly language)
- No references to internal systems, tickets, or sprint numbers
- Balance changes include before/after values
- Bug fixes describe the player experience, not the technical cause
- Tone matches the game's voice (adjust formality based on game style)

**[Product]** Check the generated notes for:
- Breaking changes are prominently flagged with migration steps
- Deprecations include timeline and replacement
- Bug fixes describe the observable symptom, not the root cause
- Links to docs/migration guides are functional
- No exposed internal paths, credentials, or infrastructure details
- Upgrade impact is clearly stated for each change

---

## Phase 6: Save Release Notes

Present the completed release notes to the user along with: a count of changes by category, and any internal changes that were excluded (for review).

Ask: "May I write these release notes to `docs/patch-notes/[version].md`?"

If yes, write the file to `docs/patch-notes/[version].md`, creating the directory
if needed. Also write to `production/releases/[version]/patch-notes.md` as the
internal archive copy.

---

## Phase 7: Next Steps

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — release notes generated and saved.

- Run `/release-checklist` to verify all other release gates are met before publishing.
- **[Game]** Share the patch notes draft with the community-manager for tone review before posting publicly.
- **[Product]** Share the release notes draft with the product owner and developer relations for review before publishing.
