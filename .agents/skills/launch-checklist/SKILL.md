> **Explicit invocation only**: This skill should only run when the user explicitly requests it with `/launch-checklist`. Do not auto-invoke based on context matching.

## User Guide

- When to use: Complete launch readiness validation. Game: platform certification, store metadata, content, community. Product: deployment strategy, rollback plan, on-call, monitoring.
- Inputs: Command arguments: `/launch-checklist [launch-date or 'dry-run']`; project artifacts referenced below; user decisions and approvals before writes.
- Outputs: Primary artifacts, reports, or conversation guidance described below; write files only after user approval.
- Memory-bank writes: None.
- Next steps: Follow the workflow hand-off or next-step guidance below; recommendations do not auto-run and require explicit user command/approval.

## Phase 0: Domain Detection

Detect the project domain by checking for concept documents in `design/cdd/`:

- **Game**: `design/cdd/game-concept.md` exists → use `[Game]` paths below
- **Product**: `design/cdd/product-concept.md` exists → use `[Product]` paths below
- **Neither**: default to game paths (preserves backward compatibility)

## Dual-Domain Parity Contract

| Area | Game branch | Product branch |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Context reads | Game Concept, milestone, release checklist, content calendar, build/store/legal/community/QA artifacts | Product Concept, milestone, release checklist, deployment config/IaC, migration/rollback docs, monitoring/on-call/support/security/docs artifacts |
| Steps | Validate code, content, platform certification, store metadata, localization, analytics, community/support, team readiness | Validate code, data/migrations, deployment strategy, rollback, monitoring/alerts, on-call/support, security/privacy, docs/customer communication, team readiness |
| Outputs | `production/releases/launch-checklist-[date].md` or dry-run report with game launch readiness and sign-offs | Same path/report with product launch readiness, deployment/rollback/on-call/monitoring support sign-offs |
| Next steps | `/team-release`, final store/platform submission, monitor launch, hotfix if needed | `/team-release`, staged production deployment, monitor/on-call, incident or hotfix if needed |

---

## Phase 1: Parse Arguments

Read the argument for the launch date or `dry-run` mode. Dry-run mode generates the checklist without creating sign-off entries or writing files.

---

## Phase 2: Gather Project Context

- Read `AGENTS.md` for tech stack, target platforms, and team structure
- Read the latest milestone in `production/milestones/`
- Read any existing release checklist in `production/releases/`
- **[Game]** Read the content calendar in `design/live-ops/content-calendar.md` if it exists
- **[Product]** Read deployment configuration and infrastructure-as-code files if they exist

---

## Phase 3: Scan Codebase Health

- Count `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK` comments and their locations
- Check for any `console.log`, `print()`, or debug output left in production code
- **[Game]** Check for placeholder assets (search for `placeholder`, `temp_`, `WIP_`)
- **[Product]** Check for hardcoded test/dev values (localhost, test credentials, debug flags)
- Check for exposed secrets, API keys, or credentials

---

## Phase 4: Generate the Launch Checklist

The launch checklist structure depends on domain detection from Phase 0.

## Phase 5: Save Checklist

Present the completed checklist and summary to the user (total items, blocking items count, conditional items count, departments with incomplete sections).

If not in dry-run mode, ask: "May I write this to `production/releases/launch-checklist-[date].md`?"

If yes, write the file, creating directories as needed.

---

## Phase 6: Next Steps

- Run `/team-release` for final release orchestration and sign-offs.
- **[Game]** Complete final store/platform submission, then monitor launch and use `/hotfix` if needed.
- **[Product]** Complete the staged production deployment, then monitor on-call signals and use incident response or `/hotfix` if needed.
