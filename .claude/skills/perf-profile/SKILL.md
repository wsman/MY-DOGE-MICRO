## User Guide

- When to use: Structured performance profiling workflow. Identifies bottlenecks, measures against budgets, and generates optimization recommendations with priority rankings. Game: CPU/GPU/frame-time. Product: API latency, DB queries, memory, throughput.
- Inputs: Command arguments: `/perf-profile [system-name or 'full']`; project artifacts referenced below; user decisions and approvals before writes.
- Outputs: Primary artifacts, reports, or conversation guidance described below; write files only after user approval.
- Memory-bank writes: None.
- Next steps: Follow the workflow hand-off or next-step guidance below; recommendations do not auto-run and require explicit user command/approval.

## Phase 0: Domain Detection

Detect the project domain by checking for concept documents in `design/cdd/`:

- **Game**: `design/cdd/game-concept.md` exists → use `[Game]` paths below
- **Product**: `design/cdd/product-concept.md` exists → use `[Product]` paths below
- **Neither**: default to game paths (preserves backward compatibility)

---

## Phase 1: Determine Scope

Read the argument:

- System name → focus profiling on that specific system
- `full` → run a comprehensive profile across all systems

---

## Phase 2: Load Performance Budgets

Check for existing performance targets in design docs or AGENTS.md.

**[Game]** Performance budgets:
- Target FPS (e.g., 60fps = 16.67ms frame budget)
- Memory budget (total and per-system)
- Load time targets
- Draw call budgets
- Network bandwidth limits (if multiplayer)

**[Product]** Performance budgets:
- API latency (p50/p95/p99 targets)
- Memory budget (total and per-service)
- Cold start time target
- Throughput (requests/sec, events/sec)
- Database query time budget
- Network bandwidth limits (if applicable)

---

## Phase 3: Analyze Codebase

### [Game] Game Profiling Targets

**CPU Profiling Targets:**
- `_process()` / `Update()` / `Tick()` functions — list all and estimate cost
- Nested loops over large collections
- String operations in hot paths
- Allocation patterns in per-frame code
- Unoptimized search/sort over game entities
- Expensive physics queries (raycasts, overlaps) every frame

**Memory Profiling Targets:**
- Large data structures and their growth patterns
- Texture/asset memory footprint estimates
- Object pool vs instantiate/destroy patterns
- Leaked references (objects that should be freed but aren't)
- Cache sizes and eviction policies

**Rendering Targets (if applicable):**
- Draw call estimates
- Overdraw from overlapping transparent objects
- Shader complexity
- Unoptimized particle systems
- Missing LODs or occlusion culling

**I/O Targets:**
- Save/load performance
- Asset loading patterns (sync vs async)
- Network message frequency and size

### [Product] Product Profiling Targets

**API Profiling Targets:**
- Endpoint handlers — list all and estimate latency
- Middleware chain cost (auth, logging, validation)
- Serialization/deserialization overhead (JSON, protobuf)
- N+1 query patterns in request handlers
- Unbounded result sets (missing pagination)

**Database Profiling Targets:**
- Missing indexes on query WHERE/JOIN columns
- Slow queries (full table scans, unoptimized joins)
- Connection pool utilization and wait time
- Transaction scope (too broad = lock contention)

**Memory Profiling Targets:**
- Large in-memory caches without eviction policies
- Unbounded collections (growing lists, maps)
- Memory retained across requests (stateful singletons)
- Leaked connections (database, HTTP, message queue)

**I/O Targets:**
- Blocking I/O on async/event-loop threads
- File read/write patterns (buffer sizes, streaming vs full load)
- Network call timeout and retry configuration
- Third-party API call latency and failure modes

Output the report with a summary: top 3 hotspots, estimated headroom vs budget, and recommended next action.

---

## Phase 5: Scope and Timeline Decision

Activate this phase only if any hotspot has Fix Effort rated M or L.

Present significant-effort items and ask the user to choose for each:

- **A) Implement the optimization** (proceed with fix now or schedule it)
- **B) Reduce feature scope** (run `/scope-check [feature]` to analyze trade-offs)
- **C) Accept the performance hit and defer to Polish phase** (log as known issue)
- **D) Escalate to technical-director for an architectural decision** (run `/architecture-decision`)

**[Game]** If multiple items are deferred to Polish (choice C), record them under `### Deferred to Polish`.
**[Product]** If multiple items are deferred (choice C), record them under `### Deferred Performance Items`.

This skill is read-only — no files are written. Verdict: **COMPLETE** — performance profile generated.

---

## Phase 6: Next Steps

- If bottlenecks require architectural change: run `/architecture-decision`.
- If scope reduction is needed: run `/scope-check [feature]`.
- To schedule optimizations: run `/sprint-plan update`.

### Rules
- Never optimize without measuring first — gut feelings about performance are unreliable
- Recommendations must include estimated impact — "make it faster" is not actionable
- **[Game]** Profile on target hardware, not just development machines
- **[Product]** Profile under realistic load, not just single-request benchmarks
- Static analysis (this skill) identifies candidates; runtime profiling confirms
